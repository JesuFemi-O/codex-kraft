# Kraft Documentation

Welcome to the Kraft documentation portal. Kraft is a toolbox for generating
high-volume synthetic CDC workloads while continuously evolving database
schemas. Use this site to understand the building blocks, wire them together,
and operate simulations confidently.

## What You'll Find

- **Overview** – Conceptual tour covering design goals, terminology, and the
  relationship between Kraft modules.
- **Getting Started** – Step-by-step instructions for installation, local
  development, running the unit and integration suites, and bringing up example
  simulations.
- **Guides** – Scenario-driven tutorials that show how to configure simulations,
  control schema evolution, and plug Kraft into your CDC pipelines.
- **API Reference** – Auto-generated documentation sourced from the code base
  (powered by ``mkdocstrings``) so you can explore classes and methods in detail.

If you're new, start with the Overview, follow the Getting Started checklist,
then dive into the guides before writing custom orchestration code.
